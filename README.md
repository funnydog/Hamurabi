## Hamurabi

This is a slightly fixed port to Python and Scheme of hamurabi.bas, an
old basic game.

The Basic version works with bwbasic, while the Scheme port has been
tested with Chez-Scheme.

The Python port should work with any Python 3 interpreter.

Please look at [This Article](https://www.jeffquast.com/post/hamurabi_bas/)
for a strategy to win the game.
